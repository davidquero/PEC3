              Bitten by a radioactive spider, high school student Peter Parker
              gained the speed, strength and powers of a spider. Adopting the
              name Spider-Man, Peter hoped to start a career using his new
              abilities. Taught that with great power comes great
              responsibility, Spidey has vowed to use his powers to help people.

              Peter Parker has always had the worst luck, but Spider-Man is a
              hit with the ladies in his latest round of adventures! The Black
              Cat is back, and her love/hate relationship with Spidey is heating
              up! Dazzler disco-dances with our hero in an early appearance not
              to be missed! But she’s not the only mutant caught in Spidey’s web
              as Mesmero returns — courtesy of writer Dennis O’Neil! And Spidey
              history is made with the debut of an all-time-great Spider-Man
              artist: John Romita Jr.! JRJR carries on the family tradition,
              creating some of the most iconic Spider-Man adventures of all time
              — beginning right here! Also featuring a Stern ’n’ Byrne oneshot,
              the first appearances of Madame Web and Hydro-Man, and Frank
              Miller’s classic Spider-Man/Doctor Strange team-up!

              Forever, Avengers: Wakanda Forever And Black Panther Annual #1.
              The Dora Milaje are venturing out of Wakanda — and adventuring
              across the Marvel Universe! It’s Wakanda’s best warriors — Okoye,
              Ayo and Aneka — on a globe-trotting mission to protect the realm
              at any cost. When they discover a threat from their homeland
              causing trouble in New York, they’ll leap into action — with or
              without their king. And that brings them to Spider-Man’s friendly
              neighborhood! But former Dora Milaje member Nakia, A.K.A. Malice,
              has set a trap to lure the Black Panther into her obsessive
              clutches — beginning by taking out his one true love, Storm of the
              X-Men! And when T’Challa joins the fight, he brings a few mighty
              friends with him — and that means Okoye, Ayo and Aneka will
              assemble alongside the Avengers!
